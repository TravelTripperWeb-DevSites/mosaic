Asking her before the tour if she could stay quiet, and that the tour was long and that she better embrace it and will not be fun at all for her. \nAlso Jeff our tour guide was kinda racist to his coworker saying things like \"of course you like Asian cars you are Asian\" \n\nHe had tons of knowledge and fun facts about the cars, but he really made us feel uncomfortable and not welcome based on what he told my little daughter at the beginning. \n\nSad experience, would love to do it again but definitely not with this guy Jeff.",

Too many unbelievable cars to see in 75 minutes, wished we spent the extra $7 to take the 120 minute extended tour. We have visited once before and almost all cars were rearranged or replaced with something just as cool. We spent almost 5 hours on all 4 floors and the old farts (me included, I'm 70) were dragging my the end. Will Definitely take that adventure again.",
