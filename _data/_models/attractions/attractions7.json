This is a premier place for photographs and for learning about whatever the subject matter is at the time of the exhibit. It’s free for the lectures and to go into the museum so that’s a nice thing$ At the present time does an exhibit about animals, see live and conservation. It’s definitely worth checking this place out but definitely call before you come down here as sometimes they may be closed between exhibits. The parking is at a major discount when you come here but make sure you bring your ticket up to the counter to be validated.",

We made it in to see the Photographic Ark and in total we had a good experience. The fact that they do this and charge nothing to the public (short of parking, but even that is heavily discounted with validation) is commendable and worth an extra star in the rating. We were surprised that the space was as small as it was, so there were narrow spaces with the work displayed throughout. The space was at capacity and that made truly taking in the work very difficult. It's unfortunate as well in that the limited amount of space had the unfortunate effect of making this truly huge project seem small. But overall it was worth the visit and I was glad were able to see this work, even if it wasn't in an ideal situation. It's also worth noting the staff was friendly and accommodating.",
