About fifty or so fruit and vegetable stands and eateries will not disappoint. The prices are reasonable and the food at the small restaurants are very good. There are also meat Shops with actual butchers (remember them) and cheese galore. A perfect place to spend the day. Breakfast, lunch and early dinner served at any time.
